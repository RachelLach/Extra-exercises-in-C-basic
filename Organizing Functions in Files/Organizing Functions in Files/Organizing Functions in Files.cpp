// When programs get more complex, then the main function becomes larger and harder to read, so I don't want to write 
// all the code here and instead, I want to divide the project into different files, each serving a purpose.
// How to take a function outside of this file and put it into a separate file. 
// The benefits: 1. It is going to make this file a little bit smaller and easier to maintain, 
// 2. Once I have this functionality, in a separate file, then I can reuse that file in different projects
